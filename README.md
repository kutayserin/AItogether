# AItogether

AItogether is a SaaS AI Platform and was built with Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, Supabase, Stripe, Clerk Auth, and Vercel. It offers a variety of AI tools, including image generation, video generation, code generation, chatbot and that's why I called it all together AI.

## Deployment (Vercel)

We use Vercel to deploy. So just do a merge Request on Master and if accepted it will automatically deploy. A preview will automatically deploy for your merge Request and Branch.

Vercel will comment under the merge request. Vercel automatically handles the environments no need to change.
